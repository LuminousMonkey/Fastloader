# FastLoader

An autostart fastloader for the Commodore 64 and the 1541 that fits
into a single sector.

Originally copied from Michael Steil,
https://github.com/mist64/fastboot1541 and converted for use with the
[Kick Assembler][http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/].

At this stage, it's main intention is for me to learn Commodore 64
coding.

# Use

This is intended to be a chain-load, use this to load a more advanced
fastloader.

# More Details
